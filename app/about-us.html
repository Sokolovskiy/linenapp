              <p class="journey-description">
                Our team of ex-bankers, technologists, and product designers
                started working in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) almost two years
                ago. Our first products were LoanScan, the leading analytics
                portal for loans issued on the Ethereum blockchain, and Bloqboard,
                a lending platform.
                <br />
                <br />
                We are launching the Linen App now because we saw a knowledge gap
                between the tech and finance savvy who earn high yield on their
                cash using stablecoins and the others who do not know how to use
                blockchain-based technologies. This provided us an opportunity to
                create new products, such as Linen Cash, which is a high-yield
                cash management service powered by lending liquidity pools on the
                Compound protocol, and the Linen Card, a debit card to spend Linen
                Cash. Our products allow the average person to take advantage of
                these new possibilities without being directly exposed to the
                volatile cryptocurrency.
                <br />
                <br />
                We have raised funding from several leading venture investors, and
                now we want to provide equity to our members so that they can
                benefit from our success, too.

              * Yield is variable and changes frequently based on supply and
              demand in the underlying digital dollar (USDC) liquidity pool on
              Compound. Linen Cash does not set or control interest rates.
              Interest rate displayed on the linan.app website and in the mobile

              Linen Cash is a cash management service that allows U.S. residents
              of certain states to supply funds into a Compound liquidity pool.
              Linen Cash is developed by Linen Mobile, Inc. Linen Mobile, Inc.
              is not a bank and the cash or digital cash (USDC) you deposit
              using Linen mobile app will not be stored at a bank. Linen Mobile,
              Inc. provides software to access Compound Liquidity pools. Funds
              supplied to Compound liquidity pools using Linen software are not
              insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any
              other government agency. You could lose money accessing liquidity
              pools using Linen mobile app.
              <br />
              <br />
              You could lose money by accessing yields through the Linen mobile
              app. Although the Compound liquidity pool that the Linen mobile
              app provides access to is overcollateralized and is monitored by
              third parties for liquidations in real-time, neither Linen nor
              Compound cannot guarantee it will do so. Accessing Compound
              liquidity pools is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal
              Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) or any other government
              agency. Compound Labs, Inc., the developer of Compound liquidity
              pools, has no legal obligation to provide software development
              support to its liquidity pools and you should not expect that
              Compound Labs, Inc. will provide software development to its
              liquidity pools at any time. It is possible that Compound
              liquidity pools will not have enough liquidity at a time of
              withdrawal if the borrowing demand becomes high.
              <br />
              <br />
              Linen Mobile, Inc. does not charge transaction or debit card fees.
