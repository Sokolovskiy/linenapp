									<div class="panel-body">We provide access to the Compound protocol that generates yields from borrowers. Loans issued by the Compound protocol are overcollateralized (115-150% of the loan value) and are monitored for liquidations in real-time.

									<br>
									Funds are held on and accessible only from your mobile device. Linen never has access to your funds. We simply provide software and service to access Compound lending pools. We are neither a lender nor a borrower.

									Linen Cash is a software and service developed by Linen Mobile, Inc.

									In addition, banks and financial organizations have many built-in costs, such as expensive branches, personnel, and infrastructure. They are also limited in what they can accept as collateral. For example, traditional financial institutions do not accept digital currency as collateral.
